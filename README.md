Sneaker Search Web application

Built for my final project showcasing all that I have learnt in the last 6 months whilst on the Black Codher Bootcamp

Web App allows users to search for a sneaker using key words and brings back the results. The advanced keyword search feature enables users to input more than one key word to narrow down searches.

Web Allows users to submit forms in order to request more information about a desired sneaker or one that may not be found on the website

Web App uses: ReactJS, NodeJS and MongoDB
